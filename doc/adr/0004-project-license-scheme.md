# 4. Project License Scheme

Date: 2018-09-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order for a project to be useful, it has to be shared with others. In order for it to be shared effectively, there needs to be a shared expectation of what can be done with it, how to make changes, whether or not changes can be made, and what if any warranty or suitablity for use claims there may be.

The license dictates how other people can use the software, and will set the tone for the community - making it easier or harder for individuals and organziations to use the software and contribute back to it.

In order to foster an active community, it is important to pick the correct license.

## Decision

The decision was made to use the Apache License version 2.0

## Consequences

* People will be able to build commercial products based off of the project.
* The license is not "viral".
* The license encourages people to contribute to the project.
* Some people may feel the license is not "strong enough" or "open source enough"
