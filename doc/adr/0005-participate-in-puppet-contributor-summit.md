# 5. Participate in Puppet Contributor Summit

Date: 2018-10-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For 2018, Puppet has changed the format of their annual conference, doing what they are calling Puppetize Live instead of PuppetConf.  This also brings about a change to their contributor summit.  Instead of a single day event on site before the conference, it is now a month long virtual event.

This decision does not directly impact the design, other than neccessitating the creation of a charter document and providing some pre-determined milestones. It does, however, provide some additional developmnet and design resources, as well as some tme constratins to help with motivation.

## Decision

I have decided to enter this project into the Puppet Contributor Summit online event for 2018.

## Consequences

* Additional resources become available
* Weekly checkins to help keep the project on track
* Deadline to be able to potentially present the project at the end of the event.
