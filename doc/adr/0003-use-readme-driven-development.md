# 3. Use readme driven development

Date: 2018-09-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Documentation for a project is critical - without it, you don't know if a project is "complete", or as a user, how to use it.  However, too much documentaion can delay the project, or lead to a good implementation of the wrong thing. This process, and the reasoning is much better explained at [this blog post](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

## Decision

This project will be developed using the readme driven decelopment process.

## Consequences

A consequence of this decision will be having clear, concise documentation of this project in a format that is easy for both the developers and end users to comprehend and make use of, without sacrificing flexibility of development.

### Easier

* Having clear, concise documentation and specifications in one location
* Having the README always be up to date

### Harder

* Having to remember to update the README before updating code
* Not having a good way to enforce this decision
