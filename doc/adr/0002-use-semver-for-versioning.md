# 2. Use SemVer for versioning

Date: 2018-09-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

How software is versioned conveys a lot of meaning to the end user. If you have a consistent, known way of versioning softeare, the end users can plan for upgrades and have a better overall expereince, and not be suprised by breaking changes.

## Decision

Use [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for the guidelines of version numbers for this project

## Consequences

### Easier

* Convey scope of changes in a release to end users

### Harder

* Thought must be given to the version number when preparing a release, to ensure the specification is followed.
