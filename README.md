# pupperware-party

A pupperware based load and performance tester for Puppet 6

## Getting Started

This section will need to be fleshed out, once the MVP is available. In this section, there will be a a way to get started quickly, for those who don't want to read all the documentation.

## Prerequisites

You will need an existing puppetserver, running at least version 6. You will also need to have a Docker Engine available.

Additionally, you will need your puppet master to be able to autosign the certificates for the nodes created by this process.
Your puppet code will also need to be set up in a way that nodes can be automatically classified - use of a naming scheme, or facts that can be placed at provision time for example.

## Installion

Installation steps will go here, once those have been determined.
